# Pakistan-Toshakhana-Project


Exploratory Analysis of Pakistan’s Toshakhana Gift Records
Introduction
The Toshakhana refers to the official state repository where gifts received by Pakistani public office holders from foreign dignitaries are recorded and stored. Under established regulations, such gifts must be declared, assessed, and in certain cases, retained upon payment of a prescribed percentage of their value.

In recent years, public discussion has focused on transparency, reporting practices, and compliance with retention cost rules. This project conducts a descriptive analysis of publicly available Toshakhana records to explore observable trends in gift valuation and retention behavior.

This analysis is exploratory and does not make legal determinations.




Research Questions

What is the total value of recorded gifts?

What proportion of high-value gifts have no recorded retention cost?

Do retention patterns vary across affiliations?

What trends appear in gift types or categories?



Dataset Description
The dataset includes structured records of gifts received by public officials, including:

Recipient name

Affiliation or designation

Assessed value

Retention cost (if recorded)

Year of receipt

Item description



The dataset does not include contextual diplomatic details, legal rulings, or complete verification of compliance procedures.



Key Findings

Approximately 20% of individuals receiving gifts valued above 30,000 show no recorded retention cost.

Observed non-payment rates vary across affiliations, with some political groups showing higher proportions compared to institutional categories such as police and media.

High-value gifts contribute disproportionately to overall variance in the dataset.

These findings are descriptive and reflect only the available data.



Limitations
The dataset may be incomplete or uneven across affiliations.

“No recorded retention cost” does not necessarily imply non-compliance.

Sample sizes differ across categories.

The dataset does not provide full legal or procedural context.



Future Directions
Further research could examine:

Whether extremely high-value gifts (>1,000,000) exhibit different retention patterns.

The aggregate value of potentially unpaid retention costs.

Trends by country of origin or gift type.

Time-based changes in valuation or reporting behavior.
